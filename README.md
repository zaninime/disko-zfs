# `disko-zfs`

> Manage your ZFS datasets declaratively

## Getting Started

First you have to add this flake as a flake input:

```nix
inputs = {
  # other inputs ...

  disko-zfs = {
    url = "github:numtide/disko-zfs";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    inputs.flake-parts.follows = "flake-parts";
    inputs.disko.follows = "disko";
  };
};
```

Next you need to add the `diskoZfs` module to your NixOS configuration. How spefically you need to do that is highly dependant, but in the most basic case something like the following should suffice:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs?ref=nixos-unstable";

    disko-zfs.url = "github:numtide/disko-zfs";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, disko-zfs, ...}:
  {
    nixosConfigurations.default = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        {
          imports = [
            inputs.disko-zfs.nixosModules.default
          ];

          # your configuration here
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

With the module in-place, you can use `disko-zfs` like so:

```nix
{
  disko.zfs = {
    enable = true;

    settings = {
      datasets = {
        "zroot/ds1/persist/var/lib/postgresql" = {
          properties."recordsize" = "128K";
        };
        "zroot/ds1/nix" = { };
        "zroot/ds1/home" = { };
        "zroot/ds1/root" = { };
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Now, when you switch your machine to this configuration, `disko-zfs` will ensure that the declared datasets along with the declared properties are configured. Any datasets not declared will be left untouched, however `disko-zfs` will list the commands it would run to destroy any extra datasets.

> [!NOTE]
> `disko-zfs` will NEVER remove any datasets. It will however unset properties, which if they hold unique information could lead to dataloss, you have been warned!

## Disko + `disko-zfs`

If you also utilize [Disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) in your NixOS configuration, `disko-zfs` will detect this and automatically include ZFS pools and datasets declared through Disko in its own configuration. As such if you have Disko, you should prefer Disko's way of declaring ZFS datasets and pools. See the [ZFS Disko example](https://github.com/nix-community/disko/blob/master/example/zfs.nix) to get an idea of how to do this.

Disko `zfs_volume` datasets are translated to ZFS volumes. A non-null Disko `size` becomes `volsize` and takes precedence over `options.volsize`. `disko-zfs` does not translate volume `extraArgs` such as sparse-volume flags or format `content`; configure those outside this module.

## Dry Running `disko-zfs`

As a specialty `disko-zfs` adds an activation script which only executes during dry activation, which will print out the command `disko-zfs` would run if you were to switch to that NixOS configuration. As such if you run:

```
nixos-rebuild --flake .#<hostname> --sudo dry-activate
```

`disko-zfs` will let you know what it would do.
